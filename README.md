### Hello world 👋

I am a .NET software engineer, with 11 years of experience, and I hold a master’s degree in computational methods and applications.

My focus is on software design, flexible software development, code quality and product management. I also embrace principles of product excellency, collaboration, domain knowledge and innovation.

I try to think out of the box the comfort zone, training with a spirit of endeavor, and accepting the inevitability of trials, errors and tribulations.

Progress is built, in effect, upon the foundations of necessary failure, that finally leads to knowledge wisdom and results. This tends to separate the achievers, who make rapid strides in their career from others.

I speak Greek, English and currently, I am leaning Italian.

Finally, I avoid to be the smartest person in the room.
